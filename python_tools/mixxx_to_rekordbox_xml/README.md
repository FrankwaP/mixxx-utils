# mixxx_to_rekordbox_xml

`mixxx_to_rekordbox_xml` export the information of the Mixxx's library
into the [xml format used by Rekordbox](https://cdn.rekordbox.com/files/20200410160904/xml_format_list.pdf).

You can then use Rekordbox to prepare a USB key: it's free for this use.

It exports:

- the tracks locations/BPM/key/...
- the hot cues as memory cues and you decide if you keep the hot cues
- the playlists

## Run the script

Set your preferences in config.ini. Then to run the script, simply use:

```bash
python mixxx_to_rekordbox_xml.py
```

## Import in Rekordbox

To import the XML file in Rekorbox:  

1. Get into "export" mode. Side note: the settings panels differ from the "performance" mode's ones, so if you want some info/help you need to make it clear that it is for the "export" mode.
2. Set up the correct xml import path in "settings > database".
3. Activate the xml view in "settings > view".

Since you already have the BPM, key, gainâ€¦ from Mixxx, you can prevent Rekordbox from recomputing these, going to "settings > analysis" to:

- deactivate the automatic analysis so you keep the values
- untick BPM/key/etc...
- (don't worry the waveform will still be computed during the export)

## Note to devs

The "Total Time" information is mandatory for the cue points to work.
